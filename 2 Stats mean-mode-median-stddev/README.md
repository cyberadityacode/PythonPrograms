### Program that uses NumPy to calculate basic statistical measures (mean, median, and standard deviation) for a given dataset


####    Mean:
       - The mean, also known as the average, is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of values.
       - It's calculated as: Mean=Sum of valuesNumber of valuesMean=Number of valuesSum of valuesâ€‹.
       - The mean is sensitive to extreme values, making it prone to being influenced by outliers.

####    Median:
       - The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is sorted in ascending or descending order.
       - If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.
       - The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean, making it a robust measure of central tendency.

####    Standard Deviation:
       - The standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values.
       - It quantifies how much the individual values in a dataset deviate from the mean.
       - A low standard deviation indicates that the values are close to the mean, while a high standard deviation suggests that the values are spread out.
